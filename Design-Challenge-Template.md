High-Level Design for Utility Bill Management System
Assumptions Made While Designing:
The product will have access to third-party APIs of mobile service providers and utility service providers for bill retrieval.
Customers will have provided necessary consent for accessing their utility bills.
The product will have a database to store customer data, utility provider details, and bill information.
Physical/Logical Design:
Modules/Components/Services:
Customer Management Module:

Responsible for onboarding new customers and storing customer data.
Manages customer details like Name, Mobile Number, Registered Services, etc.
Utility Provider Management Module:

Allows registration of new utility providers.
Stores details like API endpoints, authentication credentials, etc.
Bill Retrieval Module:

Handles the periodic retrieval of utility bills based on predefined schedules.
Interacts with third-party APIs to fetch bill details.
Notification Module:

Sends reminders and notifications to customers about their bills and recharge plans.
Utilizes email/SMS notifications for communication.
Billing Details Presentation Module:

Formats bill details for customer review before payment.
Presents details such as amount, due date, service type, etc.
Payment Gateway Integration (External):

Allows customers to make payments securely using third-party payment APIs.
Scheduler Module:

Manages the scheduling of bill retrieval and notification triggers.
Ensures bills are retrieved and notifications are sent on time.
Billing History Module:

Records and maintains a history of bills for each customer.
Proposed Technology Stacks and Frameworks:
Backend Development: Python, Django (Web Framework)
Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data), Redis (for caching)
API Integration: RESTful APIs, OAuth for authentication
Message Queue: RabbitMQ (for async processing)
Frontend (Optional): React (for admin dashboard)
Non-Functional Aspects:
Scalability:

Use cloud-based services for scalability (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Horizontal scaling of servers based on demand.
Reliability:

Implement regular backups and disaster recovery mechanisms.
Use monitoring tools for system health checks (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
Security:

Use encryption (HTTPS) for data in transit.
Store sensitive data (API credentials, customer details) securely using environment variables and encrypted storage.
Implement role-based access control for admin and user roles.
Performance:

Optimize database queries for efficient data retrieval.
Use caching mechanisms (Redis) for frequently accessed data.
Key Advantages of the Solution:
Automated bill retrieval and notification system reduces manual effort.
Centralized platform for managing customer data, utility providers, and bills.
Enhanced customer experience with timely reminders and easy payment options.
Risks to be Called Out:
Dependence on third-party APIs for bill retrieval and payment processing.
Security risks associated with handling sensitive customer information.
Alternate Approaches:
Implementing a serverless architecture for scalability and cost optimization.
Using a microservices architecture for better modularity and independent deployment of modules.
Deployment Architecture and Security:
Deployment: Utilize containerization (Docker) and container orchestration (Kubernetes) for easy deployment and scaling.
Security Measures:
Implement SSL/TLS for secure communication.
Regular security audits and penetration testing.
Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for added protection against attacks.
(Note: This is a high-level design. Detailed implementation and architecture may vary based on specific requirements, technologies, and preferences of the development team.)
