**Technical Design: Customer Utility Bill Management System**

**1. System Architecture:**
   - **Frontend:** React.js
   - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL (for structured data)
   - **External API Integration:** RESTful APIs (Mobile Operator, Electricity Provider)
   - **Scheduler:** Cron jobs
   - **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
   - **Deployment:** Docker containers, Kubernetes

**2. Frontend:**
   - User Interface (UI) for customers and administrators.
   - Customer Dashboard:
     - View bills, payment history, and recharge reminders.
     - Initiate payments.
   - Admin Dashboard:
     - Manage customer accounts.
     - Register utility providers.
   - Technologies: React.js, HTML/CSS, JavaScript.

**3. Backend:**
   - Business logic and data processing.
   - RESTful APIs for communication with the frontend.
   - JWT-based authentication for secure access.
   - Centralized error handling and logging.
   - Technologies: Node.js, Express.js.

**4. Database:**
   - Data storage for customers, utility providers, bills, payments, and reminders.
   - Tables:
     - Customer (Name, Mobile Number, Registered Services)
     - Utility Provider (Name, Type, API Endpoint, Authentication Credentials)
     - Bill (Customer ID, Provider ID, Bill Details, Due Date)
     - Payment (Customer ID, Bill ID, Amount, Status)
     - Recharge Reminder (Customer ID, Reminder Date)
   - Technologies: PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

**5. External API Integration:**
   - Communicates with external APIs provided by mobile operators and electricity companies.
   - Retrieves bill details and handles API errors and retries.
   - Data transformation for consistency.
   - Technologies: RESTful API calls, error handling, retry mechanisms.

**6. Scheduler:**
   - Cron jobs for scheduling tasks.
   - Tasks:
     - Trigger bill retrieval based on billing schedules (e.g., 10th of every month for mobile bills, 15th for electricity bills).
     - Schedule recharge reminders.
   - Ensures timely execution of critical processes.
   - Technologies: Cron jobs for task scheduling.

**7. Payment Module:**
   - Integrates with third-party payment APIs for bill payments (API details not covered here).
   - Tracks payment status and history.
   - Ensures secure and reliable payment processing.
   - Technologies: Integration with third-party payment APIs.

**8. Recharge Reminder Module:**
   - Tracks prepaid plan durations for customers.
   - Sends reminders to customers when a recharge is due.
   - Technologies: Timer-based reminders and notifications.

**9. Security and Compliance:**
   - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
   - Encryption: HTTPS for secure data transfer, encryption at rest (database).
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for user access levels.
   - Regular security audits and compliance checks.
   - Compliance with data protection regulations.

**10. Scalability and Reliability:**
   - Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP) for scalability and reliability.
   - Auto-scaling based on demand.
   - Redundancy and backups to ensure system reliability.

**11. Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for system health and performance.
   - Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) for troubleshooting and auditing.

**12. Deployment:**
   - Containerization using Docker containers for application deployment.
   - Kubernetes for container orchestration.
   - Multi-region deployment for high availability and fault tolerance.

This technical design provides a detailed overview of the system's architecture, components, technologies, and interactions. It serves as a foundation for the implementation phase, where developers will create and integrate the various system components to build the Customer Utility Bill Management System.
